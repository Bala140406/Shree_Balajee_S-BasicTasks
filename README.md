# SHAMIR'S SECRET SHARING SCHEME
1. I HAVE DONE THE GIVEN TASKS IN 2 WAYS, ONE IS USING A MODULE NAMED functools WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO REDUCE THE ELEMENTS INTO THE SECRET.
2. THE OTHER ONE IS JUST BY PURE LOGIC, GENERATING A POLYNOMIAL OF DEGREE k-1 WHERE k IS THE NUMBER OF SHARES AND CREATING A RANDOM POLYNOMIAL AND ASSUMING DIFFERENT COEEFFICIENTS.
3. THEN BASIC LOOPING TO SUBSTITUTE THE VALUES IN THE FORMULA OF LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION TO FIND THE l(i) VALUES AND DO LOOPING TO REDUCE THE ELEMENTS INTO A SINGLE VALUE, THE REDUCED VALUE IS THE SECRET.
